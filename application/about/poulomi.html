    <p>Hi! My name is Poulomi and I'm aspiring to be a full-stack web developer within the industry after I graduate.</p>

    <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
    <p>I was raised in San Jose, California</p>

    <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
    <p>I love knitting, photography, watching Netflix, solving Sudoku puzzles, and hanging out with my friends and family!</p>

    <h2>What's your dream company?</h2>
    <p>Hmmmmm. I'd probably say Adobe since I love photography and it's a company that combines the love of photographs with technology! </p>

    <h2>What grade are you in?</h2>
    <p>I'm currently in my last year here at SFSU (a senior).</p>

    <h2>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h2>
    <p>I love to physically be able to see the things that I have been working on--
        being a web developer makes it easy to see how you can apply your knowledge of both
        front-end and back-end in different fields. It's also nice to see the analytics behind
        how often users are active on the site.</p>
